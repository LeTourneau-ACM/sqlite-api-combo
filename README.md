# sqlite-api-combo
ACM meeting where we will be talking about getting data from an API and storing it in a database.

# The file that is in this initial commit is a python script that will create the SQLite database.
The structure of the single table database looks like the following:
| id             | fact         | rating       |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|integer (auto increments)| text   | integer   |
